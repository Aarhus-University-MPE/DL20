# DL20 Description

The data logger (DL20) is the newest iteration of ice core drill logger. The newest version is an improvement of the previous system (DL81), optimized for measurement precision, modulability, and the possibility to execute special measurements. The DL20 measures pressure, inclination, azimuth angles, temperature, and hole diameter. The system contains the following sensors: 2x ISD4000, 1x ISM3D, 2x linear transducers, 1x end stop button, 1x end thermistor. The intended communication is 375VDC power line using a MM74HC942N modem, this is however not implemented in the current setup, instead a 15VDC supply is used. Data is logged on local SD storage and broadcasted via modem. Data stream can be monitored live via modem once 375VDC is implemented. Stored data can be downloaded using supplied data grabber.
